# Part 2 · Organization & Framework

## Purpose of the Advanced Lab Classes

The Advanced Lab Classes (FP-I for B.Sc., FP-II for M.Sc. and M.Ed.) give you hands-on experience with modern physics experiments. By the end of the course you should be able to:

* Plan and carry out complex experimental procedures independently.
* Operate professional laboratory equipment safely and responsibly.
* Evaluate data with appropriate statistical tools and communicate findings clearly.
* Reflect on limitations, uncertainties, and improvements for future work.

## Participation & Prerequisites

* **Enrollment:** Register via the corresponding ILIAS course before the announced deadline.
* **Preparatory knowledge:** Review the relevant theoretical foundations and measurement techniques prior to your entrance discussion.
* **Safety:** Complete any mandatory safety briefings (laser, cryogenic, radiation, etc.) before entering the lab; bring proof if required.
* **Teamwork:** Experiments are usually performed in teams of two. Agree on shared responsibilities and rotate tasks during the experiment.

## Workflow & Deliverables

1. **Preparation phase**
   * Study literature, calculate expected signals, and prepare the entrance presentation.
   * Submit pre-lab questions or preparatory tasks on ILIAS if assigned.
2. **Lab phase**
   * Conduct the experiment over the scheduled days (typically 2–3 full days).
   * Maintain contemporaneous lab notes and obtain tutor signatures where required.
3. **Follow-up phase**
   * Analyze the data, evaluate uncertainties, and draft figures/tables.
   * Submit the written report and deliver the seminar talk by the deadlines posted on ILIAS.

Deliverables usually include an entrance presentation, lab notebook, written report, and seminar talk; tutors may add experiment-specific requirements.

## Schedule & Deadlines

* **Lab access:** Standard access is Monday–Friday, 09:00–17:30. Arrange special times with your tutor if needed.
* **Entrance discussion:** Held shortly before the lab phase; come prepared with slides or notes.
* **Report submission:** Due \~2 weeks after the experiment unless otherwise stated. Upload via ILIAS in PDF format.
* **Seminar presentation:** Scheduled blockwise near the end of the semester. Attend all sessions to support your peers.

All deadlines are binding. Extensions require approval from the course coordinator and a justified reason.

## Roles & Responsibilities

* **Students:** Prepare thoroughly, follow safety rules, execute measurements diligently, and submit deliverables on time.
* **Tutors:** Provide experiment-specific guidance, approve readiness during the entrance discussion, offer feedback on analysis, and grade reports and seminars.
* **Organizers:** Coordinate scheduling, maintain equipment, oversee grading standards, and support conflict resolution.

Communicate proactively. Inform your tutor immediately about absences, equipment issues, or data problems so that solutions can be arranged in time.

## Assessment & Grading

* **Entrance discussion:** Pass/fail; demonstrates readiness and understanding of safety aspects.
* **Lab performance:** Continuous assessment of engagement, experimental skills, and lab notes.
* **Report:** Graded on scientific content, data analysis quality, presentation, and adherence to guidelines.
* **Seminar:** Evaluated on clarity, structure, depth, and ability to answer questions.

Passing the course requires satisfactory performance in **all** components. Grades are communicated via HISinOne after all deliverables are accepted.
