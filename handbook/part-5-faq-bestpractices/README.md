# Part 3 · FAQ & Best Practices

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How detailed must my lab notes be?**  
**A:** Detailed enough that another student could reproduce the experiment without speaking to you. Include setup sketches, instrument settings, raw data, and observations about problems or corrections.

**Q: How many measurement points are enough?**  
**A:** Collect enough data to reveal trends and enable meaningful fits with uncertainty estimates. Plan the number of points during preparation and confirm with your tutor—quality matters more than quantity.

**Q: Can I cite old student reports?**  
**A:** No. Use textbooks, peer-reviewed articles, or official datasheets. Prior reports may mislead you and cannot be referenced.

**Q: Should I include raw data in the report?**  
**A:** Yes. Place raw data tables, extended calculations, and supplementary plots in appendices. The main text should present processed data with uncertainties and interpretation.

**Q: What if equipment fails or I lose data?**  
**A:** Inform your tutor immediately. Document the issue in your lab notes and contact the coordinator if the experiment cannot continue. Never attempt to recreate data.

**Q: How do extensions for reports work?**  
**A:** Extensions are granted only in exceptional cases (illness, documented emergencies). Request them before the deadline with justification and supporting documents.

**Q: Can we reuse code or analysis scripts from previous years?**  
**A:** Reusing publicly provided starter code is acceptable if cited. Copying previous students’ scripts is not allowed. Write your own analysis and document all external libraries.

**Q: Do I have to attend all seminar presentations?**  
**A:** Yes. Attendance and active participation are part of the course requirements. Prepare thoughtful questions for your peers.

## Best Practices Checklist

- **Start early:** Begin data analysis the same day measurements are taken while details are still fresh.
- **Plan backups:** Store raw data in at least two locations (e.g., lab PC + cloud storage via university VPN).
- **Use consistent units:** Stick to SI units throughout and convert before plotting or fitting.
- **Version control:** Track changes to analysis scripts (Git, Overleaf history) to avoid confusion.
- **Visual clarity:** Label axes with units, include legends, and avoid cluttered plots.
- **Peer review:** Exchange drafts with your lab partner for feedback before submission.
- **Tutor consultation:** Schedule a short meeting to discuss preliminary results and clarify open questions prior to finalizing the report.
- **Proofreading:** Run spell-checks, verify references, and ensure figure citations match the text.
- **Presentation rehearsal:** Practice the seminar talk aloud, ideally in front of peers, and time the full session including transitions.
- **Reflect:** After each experiment, note what worked well and what to improve next time. Continuous improvement is part of the learning process.

Keeping these practices in mind will help you stay organized, meet deadlines, and produce professional-level work throughout the Advanced Lab Classes.
