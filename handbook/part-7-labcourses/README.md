# Part 7 · Lab Courses Overview

The Advanced Laboratory Classes at the University of Freiburg are organized into several modules, each aligned with specific study programs. While the detailed selection of experiments and tasks may differ, the **overall structure, scientific guidelines, and expectations apply to all variants**.

---

## FP-I · Advanced Laboratory Course I
- **Program**: B.Sc. Physics  
- **Scope**: Introduction to advanced experimental techniques, measurement strategies, and data analysis.  
- **ECTS**: 6 credits (see the official module handbook for the B.Sc. Physics program).  
- **Content**: Students complete a set of experiments (typically 5–6) from core areas of modern physics.  
- **Goal**: Establish a systematic approach to experiment design, uncertainty treatment, and scientific reporting.

---

## FP-II · Advanced Laboratory Course II
- **Program**: M.Sc. Physics  
- **Scope**: In-depth experimental investigations with more complex setups, often over multiple days.  
- **ECTS**: 8 credits (see the official module handbook for the M.Sc. Physics program).  
- **Content**: Students select advanced experiments (typically 4–5) from a broader catalog, with strong emphasis on independent preparation.  
- **Goal**: Strengthen critical analysis, integration of theory and experiment, and advanced communication skills.

## FP-Edu · Advanced Laboratory Course for Master of Education
- **Program**: Master of Education (Physics)  
- **Scope**: Laboratory training tailored to future teachers, balancing advanced experiments with didactic reflection.  
- **ECTS**: 6 credits (see the official module handbook for the M.Ed. Physics program).  
- **Content**: Experiments are drawn from the FP catalog and supplemented with **specialized project work** aligned with teaching methodology and communication.  
- **Goal**: Combine scientific rigor with pedagogical reflection, preparing students for effective physics teaching.  
- **Specialized Projects**: Extended or specialized projects are an **integral part of FP-Edu** (not a separate course).

## General Remarks
- **Common Guidelines**: All courses follow the principles in Parts 0–6: scientific honesty, careful documentation, and rigorous uncertainty treatment.  
- **Experiment Selection**: The number and choice of experiments may differ by program, but **evaluation criteria and reporting standards are consistent**.  
- **Rulebooks**: For credit points, prerequisites, and formal regulations, consult the official **module handbooks** and university study regulations.
