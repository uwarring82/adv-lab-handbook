# Part 0 · Quick Start Guide & Navigation

Welcome to the **Handbook for the Advanced Lab Classes (FP-I & FP-II)** at the Department of Physics, University of Freiburg. This page highlights the essentials for getting started quickly and finding the help you need.

---

## Overview

The Advanced Lab Classes guide you through three recurring phases:

1. **Preparation** – Study the theory, review the recommended literature, and prepare a concise 10–15 minute introductory talk for your entrance discussion.
2. **Lab phase** – Perform the experiment in the lab, maintain complete notes, and coordinate closely with your tutor on safety and measurement plans.
3. **Follow-up** – Analyze your data (including statistical and systematic uncertainties), write your report, and prepare the seminar presentation.

> **Important:** Deadlines, submissions, grading rubrics, and experiment-specific documents are provided via **ILIAS**. This GitBook is your living handbook with checklists, tips, and best practices.

## First steps

1. **Check ILIAS** for your group assignment, experiment schedule, and submission deadlines.
2. **Read the experiment instructions** well in advance to identify required theory, safety notes, and equipment booking rules.
3. **Arrange lab appointments** with your tutor and partner(s); confirm key arrival times and access procedures.
4. **Set up your lab notes** (paper notebook or approved digital solution) and start a preparation plan with a timeline for tasks.
5. **Begin data analysis templates early**—create scripts/spreadsheets for later use so that post-lab processing is efficient.

A well-planned start prevents last-minute stress and ensures a productive lab week.
