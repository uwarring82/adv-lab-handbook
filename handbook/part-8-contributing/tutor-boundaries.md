# Tutor’s Guide to Professional Boundaries

Tutors play a central role in ensuring the integrity, fairness, and success of the Advanced Laboratory Classes. This guide sets **expectations** and **rights** for tutors, balancing responsibilities within the Lab Alliance Compact.

---

## Expectations for Tutors
- **Enable, don’t replace** student work: advise on method; do not perform analyses or write reports for students.
- **Transparency**: log major guidance decisions (why/when intervention happens).
- **Fair access**: provide equitable time and attention across student groups.
- **Assessment firewall**: give constructive feedback; grade strictly by published rubrics.
- **Escalation**: surface conflicts early; involve coordinators or the Studiendekan when needed.
- **Inclusivity & safety**: foster respectful, inclusive lab culture and uphold safety protocols.

## Rights of Tutors
- **Respectful treatment** from students and staff; zero tolerance for harassment.
- **Clear boundaries**: reasonable office hours/response windows; no 24/7 expectation.
- **Support channels**: access to coordinators, the Studiendekan, and the university ombudsperson for conflict or undue pressure.
- **Academic integrity**: right to refuse support for dishonest behavior, backed by policy.
- **Professional development**: access to feedback, training, and recognition.
