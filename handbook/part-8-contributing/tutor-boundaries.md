# Tutor’s Guide to Professional Boundaries (Quick Reference)
- **Enable, don’t replace** student work: advise on method; do not compute or write for students.
- **Transparency:** log major guidance decisions (why/when intervention happens).
- **Fair access:** equitable time/attention; publish contact/office-hour norms.
- **Assessment firewall:** feedback focuses on improvement; grades follow published rubrics.
- **Escalation:** surface conflict early; invite coordinator if misalignment persists.
