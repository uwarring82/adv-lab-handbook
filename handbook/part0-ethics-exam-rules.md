# Part 0 — Ethics, Academic Integrity & Examination Rules

## 0.0 Legal & institutional basis
These advanced lab courses are bound by the **University of Freiburg’s regulations on academic integrity** and the **study & examination regulations (SPO)** of the relevant programs. In case of any conflict, the **official statutes prevail**. Key references:
- University of Freiburg, *Regulations on Safeguarding Academic Integrity* (English).  
  (PDF)  
- University page “Redlichkeit in der Wissenschaft” (Ombudsperson, process, contacts).  
- Institute of Physics: “Redlichkeit in der Wissenschaft und gute wissenschaftliche Praxis” (overview, handout).  

**Program statutes used by our cohorts:**
- **Physics B.Sc. / (and MSc when available publicly):** Prüfungsordnung Physik (B.Sc., German, PDF).  
- **Master of Education (teaching track):** Study & Examination Regulations (non-official consolidated text; General Part, German, PDF) and the FACE information pages.

## 0.1 What constitutes misconduct (digest)
Intentional or grossly negligent:
- **Fabrication/falsification** of data or figures; selective reporting that misleads  
- **Plagiarism** (text, code, images, analysis) or use of AI/assistive tools beyond the stated rules without disclosure  
- **Unauthorized collaboration/tools**; commissioning third-party work  
- **Omitting uncertainties/negative data** so as to misrepresent results  
- **Duplicate/auto-plagiarized submissions** across courses without disclosure  
Authoritative definitions and procedures are governed by the University regulation above.

## 0.2 Lab-course good practice (minimum expectations)
- **Cite everything** used: papers, datasets, **code**, algorithms, figures.  
- Maintain a **lab notebook** and **git history**; commit significant steps.  
- Report **uncertainties, limitations, and negative results** transparently.  
- In group work, **state each member’s contributions** in the report.  
- If you discover an error after submission, **notify instructors** and file a brief **corrigendum**.

## 0.3 Reporting & procedure (short flow)
Suspicion/concern → confidential **Ombudsperson** consultation → if substantiated, referral to the competent committee (e.g., exam board) → decision & possible sanctions under the SPO. Students have the **right to respond** and **appeal** within the formal process.

## 0.4 Acknowledgment & ILIAS quiz
Before working in the lab, students must:
1) read this Part 0 and the linked institutional rules;  
2) complete the **program-specific ILIAS quiz** (course page);  
3) include the following statement (e.g. in the lab log or cover page):

> “I confirm that I have read *Part 0 — Ethics, Academic Integrity & Examination Rules* and the linked regulations of the University of Freiburg and my degree program. I will adhere to these principles in my lab work.”

For preparation, see the self-check: `../assets/part0-checklist.md`.

## 0.5 Program-specific links (maintained by staff)
- **Physics B.Sc.** — Prüfungsordnung Physik (German, PDF).  
- **Physics M.Sc.** — *(Add official link when the faculty publishes/points to the current PDF; until then, rely on the faculty study pages.)*  
- **Master of Education (teaching track)** — General Part (German, PDF); FACE information/contacts.
