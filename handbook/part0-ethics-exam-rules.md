# Part 0 – Ethics, Academic Integrity & Examination Rules

## Part 0 — Ethics, Academic Integrity & Safety Rules

### 0.0 Legal & Institutional Basis

These advanced lab courses are bound by the **University of Freiburg’s Regulations on Safeguarding Academic Integrity** and by the **Study & Examination Regulations (SPO)** of the corresponding degree programs. In the event of conflict, the **official statutes prevail**. Key references:

* University of Freiburg — _Regulations on Safeguarding Academic Integrity_ (English PDF) ([uni-freiburg.de](https://uni-freiburg.de/wp-content/uploads/Uni-Freiburg-Ordnung-Redlichkeit-in-der-Wissenschaft-en.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* University “Redlichkeit in der Wissenschaft” (Ombudsperson, process, contacts)
* Institute of Physics: _Redlichkeit in der Wissenschaft und gute wissenschaftliche Praxis_ (overview, handout)

**Program statutes (for this lab cohort):**

* Physics B.Sc.: Examination Regulations
* Physics M.Sc.: Examination Regulations
* Master of Education (teaching track): Study & Examination Regulations (e.g. M.Ed. SPO)

### 0.1 What Constitutes Misconduct (Digest)

Intentional or grossly negligent acts include, but are not limited to:

* Fabrication or falsification of data or figures; selective reporting that misleads
* Plagiarism (in text, code, images, analyses), or use of AI / assistive tools beyond allowed scope without disclosure
* Unauthorized collaboration or tools; commissioning work from third parties
* Omitting uncertainties, error bars, or negative data to misrepresent results
* Duplicate or auto-plagiarized submissions across different courses without disclosure

Authoritative definitions, classification, and procedural rules follow from the University’s regulation cited above.

### 0.2 Lab-Course Good Practice (Minimum Expectations)

* Cite **everything** used: papers, datasets, code, algorithms, figures.
* Maintain a **lab notebook** and a **git history** with meaningful commits.
* Report **uncertainties**, limitations, and **negative results** transparently.
* In group work, **state each member’s contributions** explicitly in the report.
* If an error is discovered post-submission, **notify instructors promptly** and provide a short **corrigendum**.

### 0.3 Radiation & Laser Safety

Before participating in any lab session involving radiation or lasers, students and tutors must hold **valid safety training**, valid for **12 months**. Training materials and modules are available on **ILIAS**. No access to the lab setup is permitted without completing the safety module and obtaining certification from the safety officer / instructor.

### 0.4 Reporting & Procedure (Short Flow)

Suspicion or concern → **confidential Ombudsperson consultation** → if substantiated, referral to the competent committee (e.g. exam board) → decision & possible sanctions under the SPO. Students retain the **right to respond** to allegations and to **appeal** within the formal institutional process.

### 0.5 Acknowledgment & ILIAS Quiz

Before beginning any lab work, students are required to:

1. Read this _Part 0_ and the linked institutional rules.
2. Complete the **program-specific ILIAS quiz** on the course ILIAS page.
3. Include the following statement (on lab log, cover page, or report):

> “I confirm that I have read _Part 0 — Ethics, Academic Integrity & Safety Rules_ and the linked regulations of the University of Freiburg and my degree program. I will adhere to these principles in my lab work.”
