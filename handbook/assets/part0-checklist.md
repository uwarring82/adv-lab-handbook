# Part 0 — Pre-quiz self-check

Tick through before taking the ILIAS quiz.

1. I can name at least **three** forms of misconduct relevant to lab classes.  
2. I understand how to **cite code** and external analysis tools properly.  
3. Our team will keep a **lab notebook** and **git history** with meaningful commits.  
4. Our reports will include **uncertainties/limitations** and not omit negative results.  
5. We will **declare individual contributions** in group reports.  
6. If we find post-submission errors, we will **notify instructors** and submit a **corrigendum**.

**Acknowledgment** (paste in your lab log or cover sheet):  
“I have reviewed the self-check and will complete the program-specific ILIAS quiz.”
