# Part 3 · Scientific Integrity & Lab Notes

## Scientific Integrity
Good scientific practice is non-negotiable. Throughout FP-I and FP-II you must:

- **Report honestly:** Never fabricate, alter, or selectively omit data. Record what actually happened, including failed trials.
- **Cite correctly:** Clearly distinguish between your own work and information taken from literature. Use consistent referencing in reports and presentations.
- **Ensure reproducibility:** Document procedures, parameter settings, and analysis steps so that another trained student could repeat your work.
- **Protect data:** Store raw data securely, back it up immediately, and share it only with your lab partner and tutor.
- **Work independently:** Discuss ideas with peers, but write your own report text and analysis scripts. Plagiarism detection tools are applied.

Violations of these principles can lead to failing the course and further disciplinary actions under the University’s regulations for safeguarding good scientific practice.

## Lab Notes – General Expectations
A lab notebook is a legal document of your experimental work. Keep it **chronological**, **complete**, and **legible**:

- Start each session with the **date**, experiment title, and team members present.
- Outline the **day’s objectives** and planned measurement series.
- Document the **setup** with sketches, wiring diagrams, calibration steps, and instrument settings (serial numbers, ranges, sensitivities).
- Record **raw data** directly in the notebook or tape in printed logs. Never rewrite data later without marking the change.
- Note **observations** such as environmental conditions, error sources, difficulties, or unexpected events.
- Summarize **intermediate results** (quick calculations, plots) and interpret what they imply for the next steps.
- Include **signatures** of all team members and, where requested, your tutor after each lab day.

## Digital vs. Paper Notes
- Paper notebooks are preferred unless the experiment instructions explicitly allow a digital solution.
- For digital notes, use version-controlled documents (e.g., OneNote with version history, shared LaTeX, or Jupyter notebooks) and export a PDF at the end of the experiment.
- Attach raw data files, scripts, and plots to the notebook archive; provide a clear directory structure.

## Integrating Notes into Your Report
- Reference notebook page numbers when describing procedures or critical observations.
- Use the notebook to reconstruct the timeline of measurements and to justify decisions (e.g., excluding a faulty dataset).
- During feedback meetings, have the notebook ready. Tutors may assess it as part of the lab performance grade.

Meticulous notes save time when writing the report, support credible uncertainty estimates, and demonstrate your professionalism as an experimental physicist.

## Reporting & Mediation
Questions or concerns about ethical conduct, authorship, or documentation standards can be raised confidentially. Escalation pathways and mediation procedures are governed by the [ERB Charter Outline](../../governance/erb-charter-outline.md).
