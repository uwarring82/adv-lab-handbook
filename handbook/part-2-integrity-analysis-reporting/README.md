# Part 2 Â· Integrity, Lab Work, and Reporting

## Scientific integrity
- Follow institutional and professional codes of conduct.
- Cite sources, collaborators, and tools that contributed to your work.
- Discuss unexpected results honestly instead of hiding them.

## Lab notes
- Record experimental plans, setups, raw data, and changes in real time.
- Use bound notebooks or version-controlled digital logs that are dated and signed.
- Summarize daily outcomes and outstanding questions before leaving the lab.

## Data analysis
- Quantify uncertainties and state the methods used to estimate them.
- Use appropriate models for fits, checking residuals and goodness-of-fit.
- Present processed data clearly with units, scales, and concise captions.

## Reports & presentations
- Structure communication around IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion).
- Lead with key findings, then supporting evidence and context.
- Make visuals legible, annotated, and aligned with the narrative.
- Rehearse timing, anticipate questions, and adapt explanations to the audience.
