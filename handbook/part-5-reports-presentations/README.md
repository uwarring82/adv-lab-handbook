# Part 5 · Reports & Presentations

Producing a high-quality report and seminar talk is the final step of each experiment. Start drafting while memories are fresh and your notebook is complete.

## Scientific Reports
Follow the **IMRaD** structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) and include:

1. **Title page** – Experiment title, course (FP-I/FP-II), names, matriculation numbers, tutor, date of submission.
2. **Abstract** – 5–7 sentences summarizing goals, key methods, main quantitative results with uncertainties, and major conclusions.
3. **Introduction** – Motivation, theoretical background, relevant equations, and references. Explain why the experiment matters.
4. **Methods** – Experimental setup, calibration procedures, measurement strategy, data acquisition tools, and uncertainty estimation approach.
5. **Results** – Present processed data with uncertainties, tables, figures, and statistical evaluations. Highlight comparisons with theory.
6. **Discussion** – Interpret findings, assess systematic limitations, compare to literature values, and suggest improvements.
   > **Tip:** For a deeper treatment of uncertainty propagation, statistical fitting, and significance testing, see the *Further Reading & References* section in **Part 4 · Statistics & Data Analysis**.
7. **Conclusion & Outlook** – Concise summary and potential future work.
8. **References** – Consistent citation style (APA, Harvard, numeric) using reliable sources (textbooks, peer-reviewed articles, datasheets).
9. **Appendices** – Raw data tables, extended derivations, additional plots, code snippets, or detailed uncertainty budgets.

### Formatting Tips
- Use consistent SI units and define symbols upon first use.
- Number and caption all figures and tables; reference them in the text.
- Include error bars and fit parameters directly in the figure legends or captions.
- Keep sentences concise and avoid colloquial language. Proofread for grammar and typos.
- Submit as a single PDF exported from LaTeX, Word, or similar. Ensure the file size is manageable and all fonts are embedded.

### Working with Partners
- Divide tasks (e.g., literature review, data analysis, figure production) but review each section together for coherence.
- Acknowledge contributions honestly and ensure the final document has a single voice.

## Seminar Presentations
Each experiment concludes with a seminar talk (~40 minutes presentation + 20 minutes discussion). Aim to teach the topic to peers who have not performed your experiment.

### Structure
1. **Motivation & Context** – Explain the physical phenomenon and its relevance.
2. **Theory essentials** – Present key equations, assumptions, and diagrams that support the measurements.
3. **Experimental setup** – Photographs or schematics highlighting important components and measurement techniques.
4. **Data & Analysis** – Walk through representative datasets, analysis methods, and uncertainty treatment.
5. **Results & Comparison** – Show final values with error bars; compare to literature or expected values.
6. **Conclusions & Outlook** – Summarize insights, limitations, and possible extensions.

### Delivery Guidelines
- Use large fonts (≥24 pt), minimal text per slide, and readable colour schemes.
- Rehearse timing; aim for 35–40 minutes to leave room for questions.
- Explain plots slowly: axes, units, error bars, fit quality. Do not assume the audience can read small details instantly.
- Anticipate questions about systematics, alternative interpretations, and experimental challenges.
- Provide backup slides for additional data, calibration steps, or derivations.

### Logistics
- Upload slides (PDF or PowerPoint) to ILIAS before the seminar session.
- Bring a copy on a USB stick and test compatibility with the seminar room equipment.
- Attend all seminar days; active participation and constructive questions count towards your overall impression.

Strong communication in both written and oral formats reflects your mastery of the experiment and prepares you for research internships and thesis work.
