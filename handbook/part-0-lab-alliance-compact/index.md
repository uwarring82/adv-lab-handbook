# Part 0 · Lab Alliance Compact

#### Our Commitment

You are embarking on a journey toward independent scientific work, and **you are not alone**. This Compact establishes our mutual commitments as we work together—students and tutors as partners in discovery.

### Core Principles

#### 🤝 Mutual Respect

* Every voice is heard; questions are the foundation of inquiry.
* Diverse backgrounds are strengths; ideas can be challenged, people are respected.

#### 🛡️ Psychological Safety

* You can make mistakes and learn without fear; asking for help shows maturity.
* No intimidation, belittlement, or exclusion from learning opportunities.

#### 🔬 Scientific Integrity

* Data belongs to truth, not expectations.
* Uncertainty is honesty, not failure.
* Original work is required; proper attribution is mandatory.

#### ⚖️ Shared Responsibility

* **Students:** prepare, engage, communicate openly.
* **Tutors:** guide while respecting student autonomy.
* **Everyone:** maintain a safe, inclusive, productive environment.

### Your Rights & Protections

#### Academic Freedom

* Right to question methods and interpretations; protection from grade-based coercion.

#### Fair Treatment

* Equitable access to tutor support/resources; transparent grading; reasonable accommodations.

#### Safe Reporting

* Confidential channels to report safety, ethics, or misconduct concerns; protection from retaliation.

### When Things Go Wrong: Support Structure

#### 🚨 Immediate Safety Concerns

* **Contact:** Laboratory supervisor (0761 203-7645).
* **After hours:** University security (0761 203-2222).

#### ⚠️ Academic or Interpersonal Conflicts

1. Direct communication → 2) Mediation via course coordinators → 3) Formal departmental process.

#### 📞 Confidential Support

* **Student Advisory:**
* **University Ombudsperson:**
* **Counseling Services:**&#x20;

### Practical Expectations

#### For Students

Preparation, honest lab notebooks, prompt communication, collaborative conduct.

#### For Tutors

Empowering guidance (not answers), predictable availability, professional boundaries, growth-minded feedback. See the [Tutor’s Guide to Professional Boundaries](../part-8-contributing/tutor-boundaries.md) for expectations and rights.
