# Part 4 Â· Statistics & Data Analysis

Sound data analysis underpins credible conclusions. Plan your workflow before collecting data and document every processing step.

## Core Principles
- **Separate uncertainties:** Distinguish clearly between **statistical** (random) and **systematic** (bias) contributions. Report them individually and, if combined, show the method used.
- **Traceability:** Every plotted point must be traceable back to raw data and an analysis script or calculation in your notebook.
- **Transparency:** Describe all corrections (background subtraction, efficiency factors, dead-time corrections, etc.) and justify assumptions.
- **Significant figures:** Quote results with significant digits consistent with their total uncertainty.

## Standard Tools & Methods
- **Descriptive statistics:** Mean, median, variance, standard error of the mean, confidence intervals.
- **Uncertainty propagation:** Apply differential error propagation or Monte Carlo sampling to transmit uncertainties through calculations.
- **Curve fitting:** Use linear regression, weighted least squares, or non-linear Ï‡Â² minimization depending on the model. Provide fit parameters with covariance matrices or confidence intervals.
- **Goodness-of-fit metrics:** Report Ï‡Â²/ndf, p-values, or adjusted RÂ² and comment on their implications.
- **Graphical analysis:** Plot data with error bars, include units on axes, and add residual plots to inspect systematic deviations.
- **Outlier treatment:** Apply justified criteria (e.g., Chauvenetâ€™s) and document decisions; never delete points without explanation.

### Error propagation
When combining measured quantities, propagate their uncertainties explicitlyâ€”either via first-order Taylor expansions (Gaussian approximation) or by sampling (Monte Carlo) when relationships are highly non-linear. Track correlations introduced by shared calibration constants so combined uncertainties remain credible.

### Fitting with `curve_fit`
SciPyâ€™s `curve_fit` automates non-linear least squares and supports weighting via the `sigma` argument. Supply realistic initial guesses, scale your data to avoid ill-conditioned matrices, and always inspect the returned covariance matrix (or its failure to converge) before quoting results.

### Residuals & Ï‡Â²
Residual plots reveal model misspecification and heteroscedasticity; combine them with reduced Ï‡Â² and p-values to judge fit quality. Structured trends or Ï‡Â² â‰« 1 signal unaccounted-for systematics or underestimated errorsâ€”document your diagnosis and next steps.

## Recommended Workflow
1. **Organize data** in structured folders (raw, processed, plots, scripts). Keep a README describing file contents.
2. **Calibrate first:** Convert instrument readings using calibration curves or reference measurements before main analysis.
3. **Perform preliminary checks** (quick plots, sanity checks) to identify issues while still in the lab.
4. **Automate analysis** with scripts (Python, MATLAB, ROOT, etc.). Version-control your code and comment intermediate steps.
5. **Quantify uncertainties** for each derived quantity; tabulate both statistical and systematic components.
6. **Interpret results** by comparing to theory or literature values within uncertainty bounds. Discuss discrepancies realistically.

## Documentation in Reports
- Include a dedicated subsection that explains your analysis pipeline, software used, and uncertainty evaluation.
- Present representative plots with readable legends and captions that describe what the reader should notice.
- Attach tables of raw data or long results in appendices; reference them in the main text when relevant.
- When using external code or libraries, cite them (e.g., NumPy, SciPy) and state the versions.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Estimating systematic uncertainty solely from the deviation between your result and a literature value.
- Reporting fit parameters without uncertainties or without specifying units.
- Rounding intermediate results too early, which propagates significant rounding errors.
- Ignoring correlations between measured quantities; consider covariance where applicable.

If you are unsure about a statistical method, consult your tutor early or use the statistics help desks offered by the Faculty of Physics.

## Interactive Tutorials
- [Linear Regression with Uncertainty (Pilot)](../../binder_splash/index.md)
- [Gaussian Fit with Uncertainty (Pilot)](../../binder_splash/gaussian.md)

### How to use the interactive tutorials
1. Open the tutorial via the **splash page** (acknowledgment required).
2. First Binder launch may take **2â€“5 minutes** while the environment builds; later runs are faster.
3. Save your work by **File â†’ Download as .ipynb** (Binder sessions are ephemeral).
4. If Binder is busy, try again in a few minutes or switch to local Jupyter (see repo README for setup).
