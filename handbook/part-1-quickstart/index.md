# Part 1 · Quick Start Guide & Navigation

### Semester Kickoff Briefing (5 minutes)

* Why **Part 0 · Lab Alliance Compact** matters (rope-team culture; how to escalate concerns).
* What counts as **good lab notes** and **honest analysis** (statistical vs. systematic).
* Where to find **interactive tutorials** and background readings (Part 4).
* Who to contact for **support** (tutor → coordinator → student council / ombudsperson).

## Overview

The Advanced Lab Classes guide you through three recurring phases:

1. **Preparation** – Study the theory, review the recommended literature, and prepare a concise 10–15 minute introductory talk for your entrance discussion.
2. **Lab phase** – Perform the experiment in the lab, maintain complete notes, and coordinate closely with your tutor on safety and measurement plans.
3. **Follow-up** – Analyze your data (including statistical and systematic uncertainties), write your report, and prepare the seminar presentation.

> **Important:** Deadlines, submissions, grading rubrics, and experiment-specific documents are provided via **ILIAS**. This GitBook is your living handbook with checklists, tips, and best practices.

## First steps

1. **Check ILIAS** for your group assignment, experiment schedule, and submission deadlines.
2. **Read the experiment instructions** well in advance to identify required theory, safety notes, and equipment booking rules.
3. **Arrange lab appointments** with your tutor and partner(s); confirm key arrival times and access procedures.
4. **Set up your lab notes** (paper notebook or approved digital solution) and start a preparation plan with a timeline for tasks.
5. **Begin data analysis templates early**—create scripts/spreadsheets for later use so that post-lab processing is efficient.

A well-planned start prevents last-minute stress and ensures a productive lab week.

## Communication & Support

* **Lecturer:** Prof. Dr. Karl Jakobs
* **Organization team:** Dr. Christof Bartels, Dr. Christian Weiser & Dr. Ulrich Warring – ✉️ fp@physik.uni-freiburg.de
* **Tutors:** Assigned per experiment; contact via ILIAS messaging or institutional email.

For organizational or scheduling issues, contact the coordinator. Technical and experiment-specific questions should be directed to your tutor. When in doubt, ask early.
