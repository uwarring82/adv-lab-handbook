## ⚠️ Protective Notice

This handbook is maintained for instructional convenience and evolves alongside the Advanced Laboratory programme. Updates may occur without prior notice. In all cases, the legally binding regulations of the University of Freiburg and the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics—especially the published statutes and examination regulations—take precedence over guidance given here.

If you identify conflicts, omissions, or urgent risks, please contact the course coordination team or the Studiendekan without delay so corrective action can be taken.

> **Academic integrity & Safety** The advanced lab classes follow the University of Freiburg’s integrity, and safety and examination regulations. See [**Ethics, Academic Integrity & Safety Rules**](index/part0-ethics-exam-rules.md) for the compact, procedures, and program-specific links (Physics B.Sc./M.Sc., Master of Education). A mandatory quiz is completed on **ILIAS** per program.

## Welcome

Dear students and tutors,

welcome to the _Advanced Lab Classes_ at the Department of Physics, University of Freiburg. These courses are designed as interactive, self-guided training toward independent scientific work. You will plan and perform advanced experiments, apply statistical methods to analyze your data, and communicate yourfindings in written reports and oral presentations.

Tutors are here to support you, provide guidance, and give feedback. At the same time, your responsibility is to activelyprepare, take careful notes, and uphold the highest standards of scientific honesty.

We wish you success and an enjoyable experience in the Advanced Lab Classes!

### Context

The Advanced Lab Classes (FP-I for B.Sc., FP-II for M.Sc. and M.Ed.) provide students with:

* Hands-on training in advanced experimental physics.
* Independent planning and execution of multi-day experiments.
* Application of advanced data analysis and uncertainty treatment.
* Scientific writing and oral presentation skills.

This handbook serves as a **living document** with:

* Organizational guidelines.
* Principles of scientific integrity and proper lab note taking.
* Best practices for statistics, fits, and uncertainty estimation.
* Checklists and templates for reports and presentations.
* Experiment-specific hints for individual labs

### Structure

The repository follows a modular structure:

* Part 0: Lab Alliance Compact (ethics, academic integrity & safety gateway)
* Part 1: Quick start guide & navigation
* Part 2: Organization & framework
* Part 3: Scientific integrity & lab notes
* Part 4: Statistics & data analysis
* Part 5: Reports & presentations
* Part 6: FAQ & best practices
* Part 7: Lab courses (FP-I & FP-II, experiment-specific hints)
* Part 8: Contributing & governance
