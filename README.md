## ⚠️ Protective Notice

This handbook is maintained for instructional convenience and evolves alongside the Advanced Laboratory programme. Updates may occur without prior notice. In all cases, the legally binding regulations of the University of Freiburg and the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics—especially the published statutes and examination regulations—take precedence over guidance given here.

If you identify conflicts, omissions, or urgent risks, please contact the course coordination team or the Studiendekan without delay so corrective action can be taken.

> **Academic integrity & exams** The advanced lab classes follow the University of Freiburg’s integrity and examination regulations. See [**Part 0 — Ethics, Academic Integrity & Examination Rules**](handbook/part0-ethics-exam-rules.md) for the compact, procedures, and program-specific links (Physics B.Sc./M.Sc., Master of Education). A mandatory quiz is completed on **ILIAS** per program.

## Welcome

Dear students and tutors,

welcome to the _Advanced Lab Classes_ at the Department of Physics, University of Freiburg. These courses are designed as interactive, self-guided training toward independent scientific work. You will plan and perform advanced experiments, apply statistical methods to analyze your data, and communicate yourfindings in written reports and oral presentations.

Tutors are here to support you, provide guidance, and give feedback. At the same time, your responsibility is to activelyprepare, take careful notes, and uphold the highest standards of scientific honesty.

We wish you success and an enjoyable experience in the Advanced Lab Classes!

### Context

The Advanced Lab Classes (FP-I for B.Sc., FP-II for M.Sc. and M.Ed.) provide students with:

* Hands-on training in advanced experimental physics.
* Independent planning and execution of multi-day experiments.
* Application of advanced data analysis and uncertainty treatment.
* Scientific writing and oral presentation skills.

This handbook serves as a **living document** with:

* Organizational guidelines.
* Principles of scientific integrity and proper lab note taking.
* Best practices for statistics, fits, and uncertainty estimation.
* Checklists and templates for reports and presentations.
* Experiment-specific hints for FP-I and FP-II.

### Mandatory Ethics Gateway

Before engaging with any technical content, all students and tutors must review **Part 0 · Lab Alliance Compact** and record their acknowledgment via the companion one-pager. The acknowledgment is part of the official course audit trail and is a prerequisite for proceeding to Part 1.

### Structure

The repository follows a modular structure:

* Part 0: Lab Alliance Compact (ethics gateway)
* Part 1: Quick start guide & navigation
* Part 2: Organization & framework
* Part 3: Scientific integrity & lab notes
* Part 4: Statistics & data analysis
* Part 5: Reports & presentations
* Part 6: FAQ & best practices
* Part 7: Lab courses (FP-I & FP-II, experiment-specific hints)
* Part 8: Contributing & governance

#### Binder reliability & local fallback

Binder is a free shared service; first launch can be slow or queued. If Binder is unavailable:

1. Create a local environment (`python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`)
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `jupyter notebook` and open the tutorial under `/notebooks/`.

### GitBook

This repository is synced with GitBook for user-friendly navigation and reading.
