# Binder Splash Page

This directory hosts the Binder splash page that reinforces the Lab Alliance Compact before launching any interactive content.

## Purpose
- Provide a mandatory ethical reminder prior to starting Binder sessions.
- Offer a consistent entry point that can be updated without editing individual notebooks.

## Updating the Binder Link
1. Update the placeholder URL in `index.md` with the current Binder link for the repository or specific notebook.
2. Commit the change with context so the audit trail reflects why the link was updated.

When integrating with GitBook or other portals, point Binder launch buttons to this splash page rather than directly to Binder.
